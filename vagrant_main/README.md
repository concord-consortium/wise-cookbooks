## Vagrant Main ##

This cookbook boostraps the WISE4 install. It is named "vagrant_main" because once upon a time, the WISE4 installs were done using vagrant. This cookbook should be renamed, or moved into the WISE4 cookbook  It only does a few things:

* configures a user named "vagrant"
* requires other cookbooks.

TODO:
* Put this cookbooks recipes into the WISE4 recipe.
