# A librarian git repo containing chef cook books for WISE4 servers #

This repository only contains chef cookbooks. It can be used by other projects using [librarian][librarian]. It should be consumed by another project such as [wise-chef][wise-chef] â€“ a simple replacement for the older [wise4-vagrant][wise4-vagrant]. 

*NOTE*: most of these cookbooks are *not* used, exceptions are 'vagrant_main' and 'wise4'. The other cookbooks can and should be deleted.

### Todo: ###

1. remove all cookbooks other than wise4 and vargrant_main
2. rename vagrant_main or roll it into the wise4 recipe.
3. improve this documentation
4. update wise4-vagrant to use librarian.
5. Browse the opscode knife & Chef [plugins-page][plugins-page]. Note that there are already plugins for [knife-ec2][knife-ec2], [kife-solo][knife-solo], and [knife-hatch][knife-hatch]
